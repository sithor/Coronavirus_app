## Plots of daily incident cases of Covid-19, by city or country.

This is generated from the [Johns Hopkins University website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_19-covid-Confirmed.csv), which is a tally of cumulative cases by city or country. The plots are sorted with the city or country with the highest mean daily count over the last week first. The red lines indicate lowess curves, to indicate the overall trend.

```{r plots_by_city, echo = FALSE}
for (i in 1:length(x)) {
  plot_and_lowess(country = names(x)[i])
}
